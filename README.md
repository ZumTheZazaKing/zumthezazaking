### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm ZumTheZazaKing and I'm currently studying on web development with my favourite language being JavaScript.

Most of my repositories are just small little projects I've made to test my skills and I have to say that I can see myself improving day by day.

Nonetheless, it's not enough and there's still heaps of room for improvements.

### Languages I know

- HTML (obviosuly)
- CSS
- Javascript (My favourite ðŸ’›)
- PHP
- Java
- Python


### Technologies I use

- ReactJS
- SASS
- Material UI
- Context API
- React Router DOM


All in all, I'm still learning and simply a nobody. So please don't bully me. ðŸ˜¢
